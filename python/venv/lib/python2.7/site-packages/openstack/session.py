The :class:`~openstack.session.Session` is the class that maintains session
layer similar to the OSI model session layer.  The session has a transport
and an authenticator.  The transport is used by the session and authenticator
for HTTP layer transport.  The authenticator is responsible for providing an
authentication token and an endpoint to communicate with.

Examples
--------

The following examples use the example authenticator which takes the token
and endpoint as arguments.

Create a session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructor::

    from examples import authenticator
    from openstack import session
    from openstack import transport
    xport = transport.Transport()
    token = 'SecretToken'
    endpoint = 'http://cloud.example.com:3333'
    auther = authenticator.TestAuthenticator(token, endpoint)
    sess = session.Session(xport, auther)

HTTP GET
~~~~~~~~

Making a basic HTTP GET call::

    containers = sess.get('/').json()

The containers variable will contain a list of dict describing the containers.

HTTP PUT
~~~~~~~~

Creating a new object::

    objay_data = 'roland garros'
    objay_len = len(objay_data)
    headers = {"Content-Length": objay_len, "Content-Type": "text/plain"}
    resp = sess.put('/pilots/french.txt', headers=headers, data=objay_data)
